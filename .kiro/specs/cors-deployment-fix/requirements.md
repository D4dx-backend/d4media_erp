# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configuration issue preventing the frontend application from communicating with the backend API after deployment. The frontend is deployed on Netlify and the backend on DigitalOcean, requiring proper CORS configuration to allow cross-origin requests.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user accessing the deployed application, I want to be able to sign up and make API requests without encountering CORS errors, so that I can use the application normally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to sign up from the deployed frontend THEN the backend SHALL accept the preflight OPTIONS request
2. WHEN the backend receives a request from the frontend domain THEN it SHALL include proper CORS headers in the response
3. WHEN the frontend makes API requests THEN they SHALL complete successfully without CORS blocking

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CORS configuration to be environment-aware, so that it works correctly in both development and production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs in development THEN it SHALL allow localhost origins
2. WHEN the application runs in production THEN it SHALL allow the specific Netlify domain
3. WHEN CORS is configured THEN it SHALL include all necessary headers for proper functionality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the CORS configuration to be secure and restrictive, so that only authorized domains can access the API.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CORS is configured THEN it SHALL only allow specific trusted domains
2. WHEN an unauthorized domain attempts access THEN the request SHALL be blocked
3. WHEN credentials are needed THEN the CORS configuration SHALL properly handle credential-based requests

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that the CORS configuration works correctly, so that I can ensure the deployment is functional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend is deployed THEN CORS headers SHALL be present in API responses
2. WHEN testing API endpoints THEN preflight requests SHALL be handled correctly
3. WHEN the frontend makes requests THEN they SHALL succeed without browser console errors
