# Department Management API Implementation

## Overview
This implementation provides a complete Department Management API for the D4 Media Task Management System, fulfilling task 5.1 requirements.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Department CRUD Operations

- **POST /api/v1/departments** - Create new department
- **PUT /api/v1/departments/:id** - Update department
- **DELETE /api/v1/departments/:id** - Soft delete department (deactivation)

### 2. Department Status Management
- **PATCH /api/v1/departments/:id/status** - Toggle department active/inactive status
- Safety checks prevent deactivation when department has active tasks or assigned users

### 3. Task Type Configuration
- **GET /api/v1/departments/:id/task-types** - Get department-specific task types
- **PUT /api/v1/departments/:id/task-types** - Update department task types
- Support for custom billing rates and estimated hours per task type

### 4. Advanced Features
- **Search and Filtering**: Search by name, code, or description
- **Pagination**: Configurable page size and navigation
- **Validation**: Comprehensive input validation using express-validator
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (Super Admin, Department Admin, Reception)
- **Safety Checks**: Prevent deletion/deactivation when constraints exist
- **Admin Assignment**: Automatic role assignment when setting department admin

- Detailed error responses for debugging
- Graceful handling of database errors

## Testing
- Complete unit test suite with 11 test cases
- Tests cover all CRUD operations
- Tests include error scenarios and edge cases
- Mocked dependencies for isolated testing

## Files Created/Modified
1. `server/src/controllers/departmentController.js` - Main controller implementation
2. `server/src/validators/departmentValidators.js` - Input validation rules
3. `server/src/routes/departmentRoutes.js` - Route definitions (updated from placeholder)
4. `server/src/controllers/__tests__/departmentController.test.js` - Unit tests

## Requirements Fulfilled
- ✅ 2.1: Dynamic department creation and management
- ✅ 2.2: Department admin assignment functionality  
- ✅ 2.3: Department structure modification
- ✅ 2.4: Department deactivation with data preservation
- ✅ 2.5: Task type configuration for departments

The implementation provides a robust, secure, and well-tested foundation for department management in the D4 Media Task Management System.
