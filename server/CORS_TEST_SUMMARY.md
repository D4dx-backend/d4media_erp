- Tests suspicious origin detection patterns

### 2. Local Testing Tools

- **`test-cors-local.js`**: Comprehensive local CORS testing
- Tests preflight requests (OPTIONS method)
- Validates actual API requests with CORS headers
- Tests credentials handling
- Monitors CORS security endpoints

### 3. Deployment Testing Tools

- **`test-cors-deployment.js`**: Production deployment CORS testing
- Tests cross-origin requests from production frontend
- Validates security blocking of unauthorized domains
- Tests frontend integration scenarios

### 4. Comprehensive Testing Suite

- **`test-cors-comprehensive.js`**: Combines local and deployment testing
- **`test-cors-ci.js`**: Lightweight CI/CD pipeline testing
- Provides detailed reporting and summaries

### 5. Browser-Based Testing

- **`client/src/utils/corsTest.js`**: Frontend CORS testing utility
- **`client/src/components/common/CorsTestPanel.jsx`**: React component for interactive testing
- Real-time test logging and reporting
- WebSocket connection testing

### 6. Documentation and Guides

- **`CORS_TESTING_GUIDE.md`**: Comprehensive testing guide
- **`CORS_TEST_SUMMARY.md`**: Implementation summary (this document)
- Troubleshooting guides and best practices

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Environment Setup**

   ```bash
   # Production
   export CLIENT_URL=https://d4media-erp.netlify.app
   export NODE_ENV=production

   # Development
   export NODE_ENV=development
   ```

2. **Pre-deployment Testing**

   ```bash
   npm run verify:cors
   npm run test:cors
   ```

3. **Post-deployment Verification**

   ```bash
   PRODUCTION_SERVER=https://your-backend.com npm run test:cors:deployment
   ```

4. **Continuous Monitoring**
   - Monitor `/api/v1/security/cors` endpoint
